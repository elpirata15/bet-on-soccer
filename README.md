# Bet on Soccer

## Description

Web-interface for bets on soccer tournament results with friends.


## Install

The first thing you have to do is setup the MYSQL access settings.
Copy the file `template/mysql.env` to `config/mysql.env` and adjust it to
your needs.

There is a `make` target for this purpose:

    make setup

**You should use an empty mysql database.**

Afterwards you need to create the tables to the database:

    make install


## Requirements

Server:

* PHP >= 5.4
* pecl-uuid ~ 1.0.3

Client:

* latest HTML5 support


## Maintenance

Is mainly performed via the web-interface.

For convenience there is a backup `make` target:

    make backup

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`

# Authentication inspired by: [angular-client-side-auth](https://github.com/fnakstad/angular-client-side-auth)

One way to implement authentication/authorization in Angular applications.

Note: Twitter/Facebook/Google auth is enabled by default, but you can easily turn it off by commenting out the <code>passport.use()</code> statements in the [server.js](server.js) file.
